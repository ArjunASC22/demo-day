Our application will serve as a guide to travelers to identify information about cities such as facilities for eating, shopping and accommodation, as well as important information about environmental and air safety in that location. We used API's that respond to user input whenever you type the name of a city into the search bar. The output displays the air quality index of each city as well as some facts and information about said location. We also implemented the stats functionality from our pokemon code along from a while ago where, instead of having the pokemon stats change for pokemons, we have air quality stats changing for each city.
