            <li>Air pollution is the third biggest cause of deaths worldwide.</li>
            <li><br>Environmental damage and climate change continue to be some of the biggest problems facing the world today. Despite all of these statistics, climate change still does not receive enough awareness, with some naysayers even claiming that it isn’t a real problem.</li> 
            <li><br>To solve this lack of environmental awareness, we bring in AirVision — a way to explore the world through the lens of air quality. This web application allows users to select locations and provides important environmental statistics as well as travel information about that specific location. It is ideal for planning trips, as it allows the user to discover whether a location is environmentally safe to visit and has clean air, allowing the visitor to enjoy their trip without having any adverse health effects.</li> 
            <li><br>Furthermore, AirVision encourages travel to safe places by suggesting locations to visit, stay, and eat in these cities.</li>
            <li><br>Through promoting environmental awareness and recommending travel only to places with safe environments, AirVision is an application that has the power to save lives and bring about needed environmental change.</li>
